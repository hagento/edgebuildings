\title{Compute region-wise share of convergence from regionally differentiated
efficiencies towards long-term assumption for a specific scenario.}
\usage{
compLambdaScen(
  scenAssumpSpeed,
  lastIdenticalYear,
  varySpeed = 1,
  startYearVector = 2005
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scenAssumpSpeed}{years of full regional convergence for each scenario}

\item{lastIdenticalYear}{year from which to start convergence}

\item{varySpeed}{scale speed period of transition from 2015 onward
(e.g. full convergence in 2075 and \code{varySpeed = 2} leads to
full convergence in 2045)}

\item{startYearVector}{year from which to start time series (yearly steps)}
}
\value{
data.frame with region-wise convergence shares
}
